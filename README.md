# Boutique-farmhouse
The platform gathers a variety of high-quality rural leisure services in Beijing and its surrounding areas. Users can browse and book various rural leisure services on the platform, while rural leisure businesses can post their services on the platform. The main functions of the project include rural leisure service selection, registration and login, and merchant management.
平台聚集了多家北京市周边的优质农家乐服务，用户可以在平台进行多种农家乐服务的浏览和选订，农家乐商户可以在平台发布自家的各种服务。项目主要功能包括农家乐服务选购、注册登录、商户管理等
Project Highlights:
1. Thread Safety: ① The project's order submission function uses a combination of ReentrantLock lock and ThreadPoolExecutor thread pool to ensure thread safety, and implements queue operations using newcondition for multiple users submitting orders in the process. ② For popular service grabbing, the project implements a distributed lock based on Redis cache to alleviate MySQL database pressure while ensuring thread safety for grabbing services.
2. Database Optimization: ① The project optimizes the database by creating indexes on frequently queried indicators based on query logs, improving service query speed. ② When a farmer launches a new service, they need to update both the service and tour guide data tables. The project uses transaction management to ensure data integrity and consistency. ③ The project uses a side-path cache update strategy to ensure data consistency between the database and cache when updating data. ④ Before launching a popular service, it is pre-warmed in the cache to reduce database pressure.
3. Design Patterns: ① The project uses a modular design, with classes that are reused being implemented using the singleton design pattern, ensuring that a function that needs to be repeated will only be created once, saving system resources. ② In the actual business processing part of the project, the strategy pattern is used, with interfaces being used to implement different business logic processing, and the specific implementation class being dynamically selected, for example, different payment methods are selected.
4. Function Implementation: ① The project uses JWT tokens, sessions, filters, and AOP to complete the user login function, and uses MD5 encryption to ensure user information security. ② The project stores the introduction content of the farmer services on Aliyun OSS. ③ The project completes the information auto-filling function using custom annotations and AOP. ④ The project implements the function of farmer merchants receiving order processing reminders and consumer prompts via WebSocket protocol.
